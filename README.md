# Quantum
Canncer detection( generatig random initial weights using quantum computers)

~ Taking 3 input vectors ( other vectors such as ID, radius, etc are neglected as they donâ€™t follow any trend with the output whereas these 3 together strongly associate a pattern with the output)

	- Compactness mean
	- Texture mean
	- Concavity mean

~ 1 vector output its value can be between [0,1], proper techniques of mapping and data classified as a Malign or Benign tumor.

~ Activation function used -> Sigmoid function

~ Initial Weights are calculated using Quantum true random number generator.
